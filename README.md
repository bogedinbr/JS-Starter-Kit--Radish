# Radish - The JavaScript Starter Kit
This is a kit of very simple Javascript functions that you can use or modify for your own projects.

## Radish is like a framework, but simpler
It's not as well bundled, but Radish aims to be able to provide all the functionality of popular JavaScript frameworks.  
The benefits? You can: 
- Pick and choose the functions you need
- Copy them into your code
- Modify them to your hearts content
- Or just pick them apart to see how they work. 

Feel free to take a look. And if you find anything you like, share this with your friends!
